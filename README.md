Notebooks:
1- Data info and description.
2- Data Cleaning and lemmatization using FARASA API.
3- EDA by creating word-clouds for each dialect.
4- Creating world-clouds for NLTK lemmtized lyrics after Count-Vectorizer has been implemented
5- Creating world-clouds for Farasa lemmtized lyrics after Count-Vectorizer has been applied. After that ML models has been used to predict the dialect.
6- TF-IDF and two ML models been used.
7- Word2vec model.
